<p> <b> a.<font color="brown"> ACCUMULATOR(Reg A):</font></b> The Accumulator is an 8-bit register associated with the ALU. It is used to hold one of the <B>'Operands'</B> of an Arithmetic and Logical Operation.<br> The <B>'Final Result'</B> of an Arithmetic and Logical operation is also placed in the accumulator. <br> <br><b>b. <font color="brown">GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTERS:</font></b> The 8085 microprocessor contains six 8-bit <B>'General Purpose Registers'</B>(available for user to access). They are B,C,D,E,H and L registers to hold the data  <br>of 16-bit a combination of two 8-bit register is employed known as <B>'Register Pair'</B>. <font color="RED">(B-C), (D-E), (H-L) </FONT>are the Register Pairs.
<BR><BR><B> c. <font color="brown">PROGRAM COUNTER(PC):</font></B> It is a 16-bit <b>'Special Purpose Register'</b>(only Microprocessor can access its resources). I t is used to hold the address of memory <br>of the <b>next instruction</b> to be executed next. It keeps the track of the instruction in a program while they are being executed. <br> The Microprocessor increments the contents of the next Program Counter during the execution of an instruction so that at the end of the execution of an instruction <br>it points to the next instructions address in the program.
<br><br><b> d. <font color="brown">STACK POINTER(SP):</font></b> It is a 16-bit Special function register used as <b>'Memory Pointer'</b>. A Stack is nothing but a portion of RAM. In the stack the contents of only <br>those registers are saved, which are needed in the later part of the program.<br> The Stack Pointer(SP)<font color="red"> controls the addressing of the stack</font>. The Stack Pointer contains the address of the top element of data stored in the stack.<br><br><b> e. <font color="brown">INSTRUCTION REGISTER(IR):</font></b> The Instruction Register <font color="red">holds the Opcode(Operational Code) </font>of the instruction whgich is being Decoded and Executed.<br><br><b> f.<font color="brown"> TEMPROARY REGISTER:</font></b> It is an 8-bit register associated with the ALU. It<font color="red"> holds the data during an Arithmetic/Logical Operation</font>. It is used by the <br>Microprocessor. It is not accessible to programmer.<br><br><h3> Let's have look on detailed information on <a href="flag.html"> FLAG REG..</a></h3>      </p>
